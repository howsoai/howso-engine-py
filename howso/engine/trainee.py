class Trainee(BaseTrainee):
    """
    A Howso Trainee.

    A Trainee is most closely related to what would normally be called a
    'model' in Machine Learning. It contains feature information,
    training cases, session data, parameters, and other metadata. A Trainee is
    actually a little more abstract than a model which is why we don't use
    the terms interchangeably.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
        The name of the trainee.
    features : SingleTableFeatureAttributes, optional
        The feature attributes of the trainee. Where feature ``name`` is the key
        and a sub dictionary of feature attributes is the value. If this is not
        specified in the constructor, it must be set during or before :meth:`train`.
    id : str, optional
        The unique identifier of the Trainee. The client automatically completes
        this field and the user should NOT manually use this parameter. Please use
        the ``name`` parameter to manually specify a Trainee name.
    library_type : {"st", "mt"}, optional
        The library type of the Trainee. "st" will use the single-threaded library,
        while "mt" will use the multi-threaded library.
    max_wait_time : int or float, default 30
        The number of seconds to wait for a trainee to be created and become
        available before aborting gracefully. Set to ``0`` (or None) to wait as
        long as the system-configured maximum for sufficient resources to
        become available, which is typically 20 minutes.
    persistence : {"allow", "always", "never"}, default "allow"
        The requested persistence state of the trainee.
    project : str or Project, optional
        The instance or id of the project to use for the trainee.
    metadata : dict, optional
        Any key-value pair to store as custom metadata for the trainee.
    resources : map, optional
        Customize the resources provisioned for the Trainee instance.
    client : AbstractHowsoClient, optional
        The Howso client instance to use.
    overwrite_existing : bool, default False
        Overwrite existing trainee with the same name (if exists).

        React to the provided contexts.

        If ``desired_conviction`` is specified, executes a generative react,
        producing ``action_values`` for the specified ``action_features``
        conditioned on the optionally provided ``contexts``.

        If ``desired_conviction`` is **not** specified, executes a discriminative
        react. Provided a list of ``contexts``, the trainee reacts to the model
        and produces predictions for the specified actions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        contexts : DataFrame or 2-dimensional list of object, optional
            The context values to react to.
        action_features : list of str, optional
            Feature names to treat as action features during react.
        actions : DataFrame or 2-dimensional list of object, optional

            If specified, will only return the specified explanation
            details for the given actions. (Discriminative reacts only)
        allow_nulls : bool, default False
            When true will allow return of null values if there
            are nulls in the local model for the action features, applicable
            only to discriminative reacts.
        batch_size: int, optional
            Define the number of cases to react to at once. If left unspecified,
            the batch size will be determined automatically.
        case_indices : iterable of (str, int), optional
            Iterable of Sequences, of session id and index, where index
            is the original 0-based index of the case as it was trained into
            the session. If this case does not exist, discriminative react
            outputs null, generative react ignores it.
        context_features : list of str, optional
            Feature names to treat as context features during react.
        derived_action_features : list of str, optional
            Features whose values should be computed after reaction from
            the resulting case prior to output, in the specified order.
            Must be a subset of ``action_features``.

            .. NOTE::
                Both of these derived feature lists rely on the features'
                "derived_feature_code" attribute to compute the values. If the
                "derived_feature_code" attribute is undefined or references a
                non-0 feature indices, the derived value will be null.

        derived_context_features : list of str, optional
            Features whose values should be computed from the provided
            context in the specified order.

            List of feature names that will be made available during the
            execution of post_process feature attributes.

            A 2d list of values corresponding to post_process_features that
            will be made available during the execution of post_process feature
            attributes.
        desired_conviction : float, optional
            If specified will execute a generative react. If not
            specified will execute a discriminative react. Conviction is the
            ratio of expected surprisal to generated surprisal for each
            feature generated, valid values are in the range of :math:`(0,\infty]`.
        details : map of str -> object, optional

            - feature_mda_ex_post_full : bool, optional
                If True, outputs each context feature's mean decrease in
                accuracy of predicting the action feature as an explanation detail
                given that the specified prediction was already made as
                specified by the action value. Uses both context and action
                features of the reacted case to determine that area. Uses
                full calculations, which uses leave-one-out for cases for
                computations.
            - features : list of str, optional
                A list of feature names that specifies for what features will
                per-feature details be computed (residuals, contributions,
                mda, etc.). This should generally preserve compute, but will
                not when computing details robustly. Details will be computed
                for all context and action features if this value is not
                specified.

            - feature_residuals_full : bool, optional
                If True, outputs feature residuals for all (context and action)
                features locally around the prediction. Uses only the context
                features of the reacted case to determine that area. Uses
                full calculations, which uses leave-one-out for cases for computations.
            - hypothetical_values : dict, optional
                A dictionary of feature name to feature value. If specified,
                shows how a prediction could change in a what-if scenario where
                the influential cases' context feature values are replaced with
                the specified values.  Iterates over all influential cases,
                predicting the action features each one using the updated
                hypothetical values. Outputs the predicted arithmetic over the
                influential cases for each action feature.

                cases.
            - case_feature_residual_convictions_robust : bool, optional
                If True, outputs this case's feature residual convictions for
                the region around the prediction. Uses only the context
                features of the reacted case to determine that region.
                Computed as: region feature residual divided by case feature
                residual. Uses robust calculations, which uses uniform sampling
                from the power set of features as the contexts for predictions.
            - case_feature_residual_convictions_full : bool, optional
                If True, outputs this case's feature residual convictions for

            - most_similar_cases : bool, optional
                If True, outputs an automatically determined (when
                'num_most_similar_cases' is not specified) relevant number of
                similar cases, which will first include the influential cases.
                Uses only the context features of the reacted case.

                Specifies the number of robust samples to use for each case.
                Applicable only for computing robust feature contributions or
                robust case feature contributions. Defaults to 2000. Higher
                values will take longer but provide more stable results.
            - observational_errors : bool, optional
                If True, outputs observational errors for all features as
                defined in feature attributes.
            - outlying_feature_values : bool, optional

                are outside the min or max of the corresponding feature values
                of all the cases in the local model area. Uses only the context
                features of the reacted case to determine that area.
            - prediction_stats : bool, optional
                When true outputs feature prediction stats for all (context
                and action) features locally around the prediction. The stats
                returned  are ("r2", "rmse", "spearman_coeff", "precision",
                "recall", "accuracy", "mcc", "confusion_matrix", "missing_value_accuracy").
                Uses only the context features of the reacted case to determine that area.
                Uses full calculations, which uses leave-one-out context features for
                computations.
            - selected_prediction_stats : list, optional. List of stats to output. When unspecified,
                returns all except the confusion matrix. Allowed values:

                - all : Returns all the the available prediction stats, including the confusion matrix.
                - accuracy : The number of correct predictions divided by the
                  total number of predictions.
                - confusion_matrix : A sparse map of actual feature value to a map of
                  predicted feature value to counts.
                - mae : Mean absolute error. For continuous features, this is
                  calculated as the mean of absolute values of the difference
                  between the actual and predicted values. For nominal features,
                  this is 1 - the average categorical action probability of each case's
                  correct classes. Categorical action probabilities are the probabilities
                  for each class for the action feature.
                - mda : Mean decrease in accuracy when each feature is dropped
                  from the model, applies to all features.
                - feature_mda_permutation_full : Mean decrease in accuracy that used
                  scrambling of feature values instead of dropping each
                  feature, applies to all features.
                - precision : Precision (positive predictive) value for nominal
                  features only.
                - r2 : The r-squared coefficient of determination, for
                  continuous features only.
                - recall : Recall (sensitivity) value for nominal features only.
                - rmse : Root mean squared error, for continuous features only.
                - spearman_coeff : Spearman's rank correlation coefficient,
                  for continuous features only.
                - mcc : Matthews correlation coefficient, for nominal features only.
            - similarity_conviction : bool, optional
                If True, outputs similarity conviction for the reacted case.
                Uses both context and action feature values as the case values
                for all computations. This is defined as expected (local)
                distance contribution divided by reacted case distance
                contribution.
            - generate_attempts : bool, optional
                If True outputs the number of attempts taken to generate each
                case. Only applicable when 'generate_new_cases' is "always" or
                "attempt".

        exclude_novel_nominals_from_uniqueness_check : bool, default False
            If True, will exclude features which have a subtype defined in their feature
            attributes from the uniqueness check that happens when ``generate_new_cases``
            is True. Only applies to generative reacts.
        feature_bounds_map : map of str -> map of str -> object, optional
            A mapping of feature names to the bounds for the feature values to
            be generated in. For continuous features this should be a numeric
            value, for datetimes this should be a datetime string or a numeric
            epoch value. Min bounds should be equal to or smaller than max
            bounds, except when setting the bounds around the cycle length of
            a cyclic feature. (e.g., to allow 0 +/- 60 degrees, set min=300
            and max=60).

            Example::

                {
                    "feature_a": {"min": 0},
                    "feature_b" : {"min": 1, "max": 5},
                    "feature_c": {"max": 1}
                }

        generate_new_cases : {"always", "attempt", "no"}, default "no"
            This parameter takes in a string that may be one of the following:

                - **attempt**: ``Synthesizer`` attempts to generate new cases and
                  if its not possible to generate a new case, it might
                  generate cases in "no" mode (see point c.)
                - **always**: ``Synthesizer`` always generates new cases and
                  if its not possible to generate a new case, it returns
                  ``None``.
                - **no**: ``Synthesizer`` generates data based on the
                  ``desired_conviction`` specified and the generated data is
                  not guaranteed to be a new case (that is, a case not found
                  in original dataset.)

        initial_batch_size: int, optional
            Define the number of cases to react to in the first batch. If
            unspecified, a default defined by the ``react_initial_batch_size``
            property of the selected client will be used.
            The number of cases in following batches will be automatically
            adjusted. This value is ignored if ``batch_size`` is specified.
        input_is_substituted : bool, default False
            When True, assumes provided categorical (nominal or ordinal)
            feature values have already been substituted.
        into_series_store : str, optional
            The name of a series store. If specified, will store an internal
            record of all react contexts for this session and series to be used
            later with train series.
        leave_case_out : bool, default False
            When True and specified along with ``case_indices``, each individual
            react will respectively ignore the corresponding case specified
            by ``case_indices`` by leaving it out.
        new_case_threshold : {"max", "min", "most_similar"}, default "min"
            Distance to determine the privacy cutoff.

            Possible values:

                - min: minimum distance in the original local space.
                - max: maximum distance in the original local space.
                - most_similar: distance between the nearest neighbor to the nearest
                  neighbor in the original space.
        num_cases_to_generate : int, default 1
            The number of cases to generate.
        ordered_by_specified_features : bool, default False
            When True, the order of generated feature values will match
            the order of specified features.
        preserve_feature_values : list of str, optional
            Features that will preserve their values from the case specified
            by ``case_indices``, appending and overwriting the specified
            contexts as necessary. For generative reacts, if ``case_indices``
            isn't specified will preserve feature values of a random case.
        progress_callback : callable, optional
            A callback method that will be called before each
            batched call to react and at the end of reacting. The method is
            given a ProgressTimer containing metrics on the progress and timing
            of the react operation, and the batch result.
        substitute_output : bool, default True
            When False, will not substitute categorical feature values. Only
            applicable if a substitution value map has been set.
        suppress_warning : bool, default False
            When True, warnings will not be displayed.
        use_case_weights : bool, optional
            When True, will scale influence weights by each case's
            ``weight_feature`` weight. If unspecified, case weights will
            be used if the Trainee has them.
        use_regional_model_residuals : bool, default True
            When false, uses model feature residuals. When True, recalculates
            regional model residuals.
        weight_feature : str, optional
            Name of feature whose values to use as case weights.
            When left unspecified uses the internally managed case weight.

            See parameter ``action_features`` in :meth:`react`.
        actions : DataFrame or 2-dimensional list of object, optional
            See parameter ``actions`` in :meth:`react`.
        batch_size: int, optional
            Define the number of series to react to at once. If left

        continue_series : bool, default False
            When True will attempt to continue existing series instead of
            starting new series. If ``initial_values`` provide series IDs, it
            will continue those explicitly specified IDs, otherwise it will
            randomly select series to continue.
            .. note::

            matrices when computing residuals.
        context_features : Collection of str, optional
            List of features names to use as contexts for
            computations. Default is all trained non-unique features if

            - prediction_stats : bool, optional
                If True outputs full feature prediction stats for all (context and action) features.
                The prediction stats returned are set by the "selected_prediction_stats" parameter

                context_features to predict the feature.
            - feature_contributions_full : bool, optional
                For each context_feature, use the full set of all other
                context_features to compute the mean absolute delta between
                prediction of action feature with and without the context features

                delta under the key 'directional_feature_contributions_full'.
            - feature_contributions_robust : bool, optional
                For each context_feature, use the robust (power set/permutation)
                set of all other context_features to compute the mean absolute
                delta between prediction of the action feature with and without the

            - feature_mda_robust : bool, optional
                Compute Mean Decrease in Accuracy MDA by dropping each feature and using the
                robust (power set/permutations) set of remaining context features
                for each prediction.
            - feature_feature_mda_permutation_full : bool, optional
                Compute MDA by scrambling each feature and using the
                full set of remaining context features for each prediction.
            - feature_feature_mda_permutation_robust : bool, optional
                Compute MDA by scrambling each feature and using the
                robust (power set/permutations) set of remaining context features
                for each prediction.
            - action_condition : map of str -> any, optional
                A condition map to select the action set, which is the dataset for which
                the prediction stats are for. If both ``action_condition`` and ``context_condition``

                  calculated as the mean of absolute values of the difference
                  between the actual and predicted values. For nominal features,
                  this is 1 - the average categorical action probability of each case's

            When feature influences such as contributions and mda, use this feature as
            the action feature.  If not provided, will default to the ``action_feature`` if provided.
            If ``action_feature`` is not provided and feature influences ``details`` are
            selected, this feature must be provided.
        hyperparameter_param_path : Collection of str, optional.

            Total sample size of model to use (using sampling with replacement)
            for robust mda and residual computation.
            Defaults to 1000 * (1 + log(number of features)).  Note: robust mda
            will be updated to use num_robust_influence_samples in a future release.
        num_robust_influence_samples_per_case : int, optional
            Specifies the number of robust samples to use for each case for
            robust contribution computations.
            Defaults to 300 + 2 * (number of features).
        num_samples : int, optional
            Total sample size of model to use (using sampling with replacement)
            for all non-robust computation. Defaults to 1000.

            action feature first. If both ``prediction_stats_action_feature`` and
            ``action_feature`` are not provided, by default residuals and prediction
            stats uses ".targetless" hyperparameters. If "action_feature" is provided,

            (using sampling without replacement). Applicable only to non-robust
            computation. Ignored if num_samples is specified.
            Higher values provide better accuracy at the cost of compute time.

    name_or_id : str, optional
        The name or id of the trainee. Deletes the Trainees from memory and attempts to delete a Trainee saved under
